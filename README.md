The purpose of the following analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to help prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

##Results
- If we look at the retiring_titles table below, we can see that there will be a total of 72,458 positions that will need to be filled.

- Most of those positions will be of *Senior Engineer* and *Senior Staff*.
